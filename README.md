# BlurryNoise (incomplete - never finished)

Problem was that id like to listen to some songs that have nice instrumental and adlibs/voice, but when studying the voice is very distracting--but it sounds good. Thus id want to make it sort of blurry or faded so as not to be distracting, but it still sounds good. The model portion of this was never implemented to convert the audio, frontend is partial complete.
